# Budgetly

## Never loose track of you monthly budget again!

It is so easy to lose track of your monthly expenses: The early morning coffee from the local bakery, going out to eat with friends, having a beer with colleagues... That's where Budgetly comes into play: Budgetly helps you to keep a comfortable overview of your financial status at any time.

This app was developed as my capstone project during the final four weeks of the neuefische Web Development Bootcamp in September 2020 in Hamburg, Germany.
Budgetly is optimized for mobile usage, so please switch your browser to responsive mode (iPhone 6/7/8)

Take a look at the app here here or watch the demo below.
